# Custom Gomoku

Gomoku/TicTacToe implementation using inheritance, board dimensions and win condition are customizable by player.

Notable algorithm that I designed is the "draw" function in gomoku.cpp, which checks for any feasible paths to victory for either player, returning a tie if none exist.
